# ExpenseTracker
In the creation of a personal expense tracker app, my goal was to deliver a tool for understanding and managing finances. 
The app incorporates a login/signup feature to safeguard users' privacy.
To provide users with a realistic experience, I opted for manual input of expenses on the main page. 
Users can specify the amount, date, notes, and category for each expense. The app offers flexibility with options to add new categories, set monthly budgets, 
delete selected expenses, and log out securely.
The main page provides a range of choices for users, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience in managing their financial transactions.
Moving beyond mere expense tracking, the app offers dynamic chart visualizations for insightful financial analysis. 
Users can configure charts by selecting time periods and specific categories. 
The charts cover monthly expenses, budget summaries, expense trends, and a pie chart detailing category proportions.
Upon entering the chart configuration page, users can further customize their analysis by choosing specific time frames and categories. 
The subsequent chart display includes a bar chart illustrating monthly expenses and budget, a total balance overview, a line graph depicting expense trends, 
and a pie chart showcasing category distribution.
